# LocalMock introduction

## What is LocalMock ?

LocalMock is a mock scheme for local development environment, at business domain name to fetch local devServer page resources. It is a reliable technical solution for local development and debugging. Compared with the general local development method, it mainly has the following features:

- ðŸŽ‰**without proxy**, you do not need to map domain to local. (like: Charles Map Remoteï¼‰
- ðŸš€**devServer only**, you do not need to start the node server at the same time.
- ðŸŒ»**One-click debugging**, through the local-mock-easy plugin, you can start debugging on the mobile machine with one click.

## Get Started

localMock need to install [local-mock-middleware](https://www.npmjs.com/package/local-mock-middleware) in nodejs server and [local-mock-easy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/local-mock-easy) in devServer

### Step1: install local-mock-middleware middleware

Add localMock middleware, when `req.query` contains key named`localMock`, local-mock-middleware will generate and return a html includes mock function.

```js
const express = require('express')
const { expressMiddleware } = require('local-mock-middleware')

const app = express()

const middleware = expressMiddleware({
  isOpen: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'dev',
})

app.use(middleware)
```

### Step2: install local-mock-easy plugin

// #!if ENV === "development"
import eruda from 'eruda'
import { erudaLocalMock } from 'local-mock-easy'

eruda.init()

const localMockplugin = erudaLocalMock(eruda, {})

// #!endif
